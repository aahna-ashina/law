# Evidence submission process

For Parties to open a dispute, respond to a claim or otherwise engage with a disputed agreement, they will need an Skiff Ethereum alias created by [linking their Ethereum account within Skiff](https://skiff.com/blog/ethereum-wallet-email).

## Communicating with judges

### Communication mechanism

The only valid communication mechanism between Parties and Judges is Skiff. Parties and Judges shall only communicate with their Skiff Ethereum alias.

### Evidence submission

Any evidence to support claims or respond to them must be attached to emails within Skiff. Any evidence over 25MB will be sent using Tresorit Send. Only Parties can submit evidence related to a dispute or participate in the dispute process.

### Privacy

All communications between Parties and Judges will be strictly private. No other parties shall be included in the communications between Parties and Judges. No private communications between Parties and Judges shall be released to the public or anyone else outside those groups.

In case of a judge being replaced, Parties and Judges shall, within the next 7 days, exclude them from all future communications related to the dispute. 

Failure to comply with these privacy rules will result in the infringing party being ruled entirely liable for the maximum possible amount of losses within the agreement.

### Platform malfunction

In case of a malfunction within Skiff, the Judges Multisig will post a joint statement declaring the use of Ethermail instead of Skiff. All Parties and Judges shall continue adhering to the same procedures detailed for Skiff, but instead of using their Skiff Ethereum alias, they must use their Ethermail address.
