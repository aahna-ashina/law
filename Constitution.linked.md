# Constitution of Nation3

[[toc]]

## The Republic and the Constitution
Nation3 is formed as a sovereign constitutional republic governed by its Citizens who constitute the Nation3 DAO.

Nation3 is a sovereign constitutional republic.

Nation3 DAO shall be the embodiment of Nation3 and its nexus with the Citizens.

Nation3 DAO shall live as a Smart Contract and never surrender its sovereignty to any other state.

This Constitution is the supreme law of Nation3 and any law enacted by the DAO after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.

### Amendment of Constitution
This Constitution might be amended, but not suspended.


## Fundamental Freedoms and Rights
Nation3 adheres to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Animal Rights. Their contents shall be considered as a paramount part of this Constitution.

## Citizenship
All Citizens consent to and agree to become legally bound by this Constitution, enforceable in accordance with its terms under the laws of the Nation3 Jurisdiction.

### Rights of Citizenship
Every Citizen shall have governance power over the DAO, as determined by this Constitution and the Designated Smart Contracts.

A Citizen is deemed so if holding a Passport in their Ethereum address and having cryptographically signed their agreement to this Constitution.

The DAO might amend the processes to issue and distribute Passports by modifying the relevant Designated Smart Contracts.

### Losing Citizenship
A Citizen might lose their status under the following conditions:
a) Failing to keep their passport balance above Minimum Passport Balance.
b) If, after a fair trial in the Nation3 Jurisdiction, the citizen is ruled guilty of severely breaching this Constitution.

### Duties of Citizens
Every Citizen shall uphold this Constitution and participate in DAO Governance in order to ensure that the DAO keeps its spirit loyal to the Nation3 Manifesto.


### Representation
Status as a Citizen does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and Citizenship Rights do not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of a Citizen to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of the DAO or any other Citizen, to bind the DAO or any other Citizen to any Contract or Liability or to Convey any DAO Property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of the DAO or any Citizen.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Citizen shall be deemed the partner of the DAO or any other Citizen. No Citizen shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent to any person that such Citizen or any other Citizen has any such authority, right or power.

### Liability
Any Citizen might enter Nation3 Jurisdiction Agreements with any other Citizen and/or the DAO. Any Citizen, or the DAO, might only be rendered Liable for the assets present in such an agreement as determined by the Designated Smart Contracts.

Unless explicitly determined in Nation3 Jurisdiction Agreements, no Citizen shall be (or shall be deemed to be) Liable for any Liability of the DAO or any other Citizen.

Unless explicitly determined in Nation3 Jurisdiction Agreements, this clause shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of the DAO or any Citizen to indemnify or compensate any Citizen from, or hold any Citizen harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such Citizen under any applicable law, in connection with the Citizen's participation in the DAO or otherwise.

### 


Every Citizen shall be able to submit Governance Proposals. Governance Proposals shall be subject to a period in which any Citizen might dispute their constitutionality or North Star Metrics alignment in the Supreme Court.

Governance Proposals shall be subject to the Governance Process.

### Ratification
Governance Proposals approved by Citizens shall be ratified by veNATION Holders on the DAO. Proposals for ratification on the DAO shall be submitted by the Guardian Guild, following the will of the Citizens.
